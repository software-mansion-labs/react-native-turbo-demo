# React Native Web Screen

React Native Web Screen is an open source library that will allow you to easily bring your web application into the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) mobile world. It allows you to render web views as if they were real native screens, caching the results and providing native animation between screens. You can easily move your entire web app, or embed a few screens that pretend to be native, without having to code them second time in React Native.
